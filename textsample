HOMEO VARIABLES AND DRIVES
----------------------------------------
time 
ideal :15 sec , decreasing by 1 for each second passed
|
urgency : magnitude increases from 0 10 15 
reward decreases -> -(urgency) added to reward


energy 
start 0 and decreases by 1 if agent moves away from goal 
|
stamina= 0-energy
magnitude increases
reward decreases -> -(stamina) is added to reward


collision
ideal 0 and decreases by  1 for each collision
|
pain : ideal-collision
magnitude increases
reward decreases  -> -(pain) added to reward 


WEIGHT FACTORS (based on graph estimation , further experimentation required)
-----------------

weight factor for urgency:
As fraction of distance to be covered(i.e, x= estimated dist to goal/total dist to goal at start) ix x>1 round it to 1 ) increases , weight also increases for our drive 
weight factor: 2*(1-\{1+x})


weight factor for pain:
x=no of collisions in past time steps / total time steps
weight factor =x 
i.e , y=x suits it :)


weight for stamina:
0 ,1   

METRICS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I.Avg score 
II.Avg collision ratio , where collision ratio= no of colllisions/total no of moves 
III.success ratio : no of times goal reached/total no of games
--------Develop a metric that shows how fast goal is reached ???????-------

calculate each of these metrics for these cases :

Normal RL 
RL with all emotions 
RL with pain  only 
RL with stamina only 
RL with urgency only 
RL with both stamina and pain
RL with both stamina and urgency 
RL with both urgency and pain
